    <tourTitle>2 Days Adrift the Salton Sea</tourTitle>
    <packageTitle>From Desert to Sea</packageTitle>
    <description>The Salton Sea is saltier than the Pacific, an unusual feat for inland body of water. And even though its salinity has risen over the years, due in part to lack of outflows and pollution from agricultural runoff, it has attracted a small, but dedicated population. The sea itself offers recreational opportunities including boating, camping, off-roading, hiking, use of personal watercraft, photography and bird watching. The sea has been termed a "crown jewel of avian biodiversity," being a major resting stop on the Pacific Flyway, a migratory path for birds. 2 Days Adrift the Salton Sea includes two nights accommodations at the Bombay Beach Inn, boat rental at the Salton City Harbor, and a guided fishing tour.</description>

    <tourTitle>Avila Beach Hot Springs</tourTitle>
    <packageTitle>California Hotsprings</packageTitle>
    <description>Chumash have occupied Avila Beach for centuries, but it wasn't until the late 19th century that the rest of California realized its ideal climate, proximity to the ocean and artesian springs made Avila Beach an ideal resort town. The hot springs in Avila are really unique, creating pools that hover at a natural 104 degrees, which draws aficionados from far and wide.  You'll stay at the historic Avila Hot Springs Resort, situated between oak-covered foothills that keep the morning fog away and make a natural year round air conditioner, which will enhance a nice morning, afternoon, or evening swim. This package include a two night stay in a private cabin above the springs, and a 3 day pass to the fresh water pool and 400 sq feet hot mineral pool. Optional day trips include two hour kayaking tours (we love the Cave Expedition) from Central Coast Kayaks and docent-led trips from the Point San Luis Lighthouse down the Pechos Trail.</description>

    <tourTitle>Big Sur Retreat</tourTitle>
    <packageTitle>Backpack Cal</packageTitle>
    <description>The region known as Big Sur is like Yosemite's younger cousin, with all the redwood scaling, rock climbing and, best of all, hiking that the larger park has to offer. Robison Jeffers once said, ""Big Sur is the greatest meeting of land and sea in the world,"" but the highlights are only accessible on foot. Our 3-day tour allows you to choose from multiple hikes led by experienced guides during the day, while comfortably situated in the evenings at the historic Big Sur River Inn. Take a tranquil walk to the coastal waterfall at Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Par or hike to the Married Redwoods. If you're prepared for a more strenuous climb, try Ollason's Peak in Toro Park. An optional 4th day includes admission to the Henry Miller Library and the Point Reyes Lighthouse.</description>

    <tourTitle>In the Steps of John Muir</tourTitle>
    <packageTitle>Backpack Cal</packageTitle>
    <description>John Muir famously walked from San Francisco to Yosemite, an astounding 300 miles, and this tour is designed to trace his steps-- at least part of the way. This tour is not for the faint of heart though. This is a true backpacker's adventure, 37 miles in 3 days. Along the way, you'll bear witness to the classic monuments of Yosemite, such as Vernal Falls, Nevada Falls, Half Dome, Cathedral Peak, Tuolumne Meadows and Mt. Lyell. At Nevada Falls, the trail becomes narrow and from then on, you'll be privy to a ""secret"" Yosemite, including a rarely seen face of Half Dome. John Muir Trail tickets are required- and hard to come by- but Explore California has you covered. We'll also provide a checklist so that you come prepared with the right equipment and a seasoned guide for your tour.</description>

The tour ends with a stop at Sunset Point, where on a clear day, you can see all the way to Mexico.     "</description>

    <description>This 2 day, 1 night tour takes you deep into the heart of Death Valley National Park. Due to extreme temperatures (120 degrees and higher) in the summer months, this tour is only offered November through April.  This overnighter is no picnic though. Our guide will lead you on a 12 mile, off-trail hike down Death Valley Wash and into the backcountry for an overnight, hard terrain camping. Luckily, 12 miles takes you out of range of almost any city lights, something that draws thousands of star gazers to Death Valley ever year. If you can survive the 12 miles back, take advantage of the location to stop in at Scotty's Castle, a genuine castle built by the eccentric and wealthy Walter Scott for his wife. This tour will make you truly appreciate modern luxuries.</description>

    <tourTitle>The Mt. Whitney Climbers Tour</tourTitle>
    <packageTitle>Backpack Cal</packageTitle>
    <description>Backpackers and hikers taking the Mt. Whitney Climbers Tour won't need hooks and rappelling gear, but they will need to be on the look out for majestic sunrises, giant granite peaks and everything from brown bears to marmots. You'll approach the towering peak from the trailhead on the western face, starting 6,000 feet above sea level. The Mt. Whitney Trail extends 11 miles and another 8 feet up to the peak. While no expensive training is required, you'll still need planning, permits, and preparation. Explore California will set you up with a trail permit, a two night camping pass, and an expert guide. We'll also help outfit you with the correct gear and make sure you are prepared for the length and elevation gain of the climb.</description>
